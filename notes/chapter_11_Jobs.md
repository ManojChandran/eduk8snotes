# Introduction 
Last chapter we discussed about the workload managements object `daemonSet`. In this chapter,  we will learn in detail on  workload `JOBs` management object.

### What are JOBs in Kubernetes?
A Kubernetes Job is a resource object that ensures a specified number of pods successfully complete a particular task. Unlike Deployments, which are designed to keep applications running indefinitely, Jobs are intended for tasks that have a clear start and end.

### What are the types of JOBs in Kubernetes?

### What Happens when a Kubernetes Job Fails?
### How to Re-run a Kubernetes Job?
### What are the things to Check Before Re-running a failed Job?
### How to check the JOB status?


## Conclusion
We covered the kubernetes JOB's, as part of the work load management.
